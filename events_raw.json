Segregation of minorities is usually deemed to be negative because the isolation is associated with problems in education, employment, poverty, safety, and health care . A traditional analysis of segregation on the basis of a study of activity places (residence, place of work, leisure) may not show the complete picture of the population processes because the activities may take place across many different places or activities. Thus, researches have increasingly highlighted the need to study segregation in the whole extent of the places of activity of people and in the whole extent of the 24-hour activity cycle. Such studies are becoming possible and interesting in connection with taking into use of various modern tracking data, which enable to observe people ubiquitously in time and space. The use of such data is limited by many restrictions related to the right of use of the data and privacy. There are also huge methodological and theoretical challenges. How to enrich quantitative tracking data to a level interesting to modern social sciences? How to make space-time tracking data statistically processable? How to interpolate them spatially and temporally?</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Rein Ahas</strong></p><p><em>University of Tartu</em></p><p><em>Faculty of Science and Technology</em></p><p><em>Institute of Ecology and Earth Sciences</em></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p>",

Such localization has been well-known since the work of Aubry and Andr\u00e9 and, in modern quantum optical systems, quasiperiodic `disorder' has become a standard tool for inducing Anderson localization.\u00a0</p><p>In this talk, I will describe how the interplay of symmetry breaking and localization in the presence of quasiperiodic modulation leads to a surprisingly rich range of phenomena in transverse field Ising chains. I will begin with the phase diagram at zero temperature, which exhibits paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases with localized or extended low-energy excitations. We will discover a robust new quantum Ising transition whose properties are intermediate between those of the clean and random Ising transitions. We will then turn the dynamical phases at 'infinite temperature', where we will find a 'quasiperiodic Ising glass' phase with dynamical order protected by localization. We will discuss melting transitions out of this glass phase and new dualities in the quasiperiodic Ising model.</p><p>Faculty Host: Yuan-ming Lu</p><p>\u00a0</p>",

Anecdotal evidence suggests that this may be a problem in the philosophy department as well. Depression is known to impair the quality of life, as well as the professional outcomes (such as academic job market success rates) of those who suffer from it. Thus, it is important to talk about the different ways in which depression can impact one's life in graduate school, and various resources available for dealing with depression. I conclude with a few suggestions for ways in which the philosophy department as a whole can better address this problem. At a minimum, I believe that a department-wide increase in mental health awareness, as well as a reduction in the stigma associated with depression, can only lead to positive changes- both for individual students, and for the department as a whole.</p>",

The multiscale hierarchical structure, ranging from micro lamellae down to nanoparticles, renders seashells multilevel strengthening and toughening mechanisms such as crack deflection, interlocking, lamellae\u2019s deformability, biopolymer\u2019s viscosity, nanoparticle rotation, deformation twining in nanoparticles, and amorphization, jointly contributing to seashell\u2019s ultra-high mechanical robustness. To realize nature\u2019s performance in engineering materials, we need to intelligently design and select materials.

        "content": "<p>Over the past decade significant progress has been made in the development of multifunctional materials, which seek to combine multiple material behaviors or properties into a single component.\u00a0 However, the system level benefits offered by multifunctional materials often come at a price, with the performance in each functionality alone being inferior.\u00a0 The ultimate goal for multifunctional materials is to not only consolidate systems, but also simultaneously improve the behavior in each use.\u00a0 The creation of such a material would yield a paradigm shift and open clear pathways to the acceptance of this new class of materials.\u00a0 This talk will discuss a methodology to yield new materials with the potential to achieve this goal.\u00a0 Our efforts primarily focus on the use of geometric anisotropy to achieve both local reinforcement of a composite material while imparting a variety of functionalities ranging from embedded sensing and actuation to self-healing.\u00a0 Our efforts to understand the mechanism responsible for the improved behavior will be discussed along with our current efforts to develop new materials which capitalize upon the principle learned to achieve further material gains.\u00a0 Lastly our efforts to develop self-healing polymers with mechanical behavior comparable to composite grade epoxies will be discussed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>About the Speaker</strong></p>\n\n<p>Dr. Sodano is a Professor in the Aerospace Engineering Department at the University of Michigan with appointments in the Materials Science and Engineering and Macromolecular Science and Engineering Departments.\u00a0 \u00a0His research lies in advanced materials with focus on composite materials, multifunctional materials, additive manufacturing, ceramics and nanotechnology.\u00a0 He received his Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from Virginia Tech in 2005, his M.S. in 2003 and his B.S in 2002 also from Virginia Tech.\u00a0 He has published 223 technical articles (6 book chapters, 106 refereed journals published or submitted and 111 proceedings) and made over 100 international presentations including his selection for a presentation at the National Academy\u2019s 2008 German-American Frontiers of Engineering Symposium.\u00a0 He currently serves as an associate editor of four journals and was awarded the NSF CAREER award in 2009, the American Society of Composites Young Researcher Award in 2012, the ASME Gary Anderson Award for Early Career Achievement in 2009, Virginia Tech\u2019s 2010 Outstanding Recent Alumni Award, Arizona State University\u2019s 2009 Faculty Achievement Award in Research Excellence, NASA Tech Brief Awards in 2010 and 2014, and was inducted into Virginia Tech\u2019s Academy of Engineering Excellence in 2010.

        "description": "In this engaging talk by film scholar Alan O\u2019Leary, explore the use of cultural stereotypes in depictions of protest, both in postcolonial filmmaking and in popular culture at large.\n\nThe talk begins with Gillo Pontecorvo\u2019s influential 1966 film The Battle of Algiers, a harrowing look at the Algerian struggle for independence from French occupation in the 1950s. Paradoxically, the film uses Orientalist stereotypes\u2014in this case, visual and conceptual clich\u00e9s about North African women\u2014to celebrate the Algerian struggle against the French colonizer. What does the gendered portrayal of nationalist struggle tell us about stereotypes and protest more broadly?\n\nTo answer this question, we\u2019ll reconsider postcolonial ideas of hybrid culture and what scholar Homi Bhabha calls \u201cthe third space\u201d in relation to theories of difference and the exotic, including Charles Forsdick\u2019s study of Victor Segalen. We\u2019ll also examine the so-called \u201cbanlieue cinema\u201d in France (such as the 1995 film La haine), as well as more recent material like Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s visual album Lemonade (2016) and Kendall Jenner\u2019s reviled Pepsi commercial. In the course of the lecture, \u201cprotesting stereotypes\u201d will take on a double meaning: the protest against stereotypes\u2014the attempt by those \u201csubject\u201d to stereotyping, colonization, and oppression to assert themselves\u2014but also stereotypes of protest, where imagery of activism becomes commodified and clich\u00e9d.\n\nDr. Alan O\u2019Leary is professor of film and cultural studies and director of research and innovation in the School of Languages, Cultures, and Societies at the University of Leeds, UK.

For Western Asia, \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck (7100-5950 BC) in central Anatolia (Turkey), presents a comprehensive and contextualized setting for interpreting living circumstances in this highly dynamic period of human history. This presentation provides an overview of the bioarchaeology of \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck in order to characterize patterns of life conditions in the first urban setting.\u00a0Speaker: Clark Larsen, Distinguished University Professor, The Ohio State University\u00a0Clark Spencer Larsen has been on the faculty of The Ohio State University since 2001, and currently serves as Distinguished University Professor. He received his B.A. in anthropology from Kansas State University (1974), and holds an M.A. (1975) and Ph.D. (1980) in biological anthropology from the University of Michigan.

His research is primarily focussed on biocultural adaptation in the last 10,000 years of human evolution, with particular emphasis on the history of health, well-being, and lifestyle. He has directed or co-directed field and lab-based research programs in North America, Italy, and Turkey. Larsen is the co-director of the Global History of Health Project, an international collaboration involved in the study of ancient skeletons from all continents in order to track health changes since the late Paleolithic. He is the author of numerous scientific articles and has authored or edited 35 books and monographs, including Bioarchaeology: Interpreting Behavior from the Human Skeleton (Cambridge University Press), Skeletons in Our Closet: Revealing Our Past through Bioarchaeology (Princeton University Press), and Bioarchaeology of Spanish Florida: The Impact of Colonialism (University Press of Florida).

This is a variation on the existing compulsive gambler process; in that process, initial fortunes are prescribed and no further allowances are given out. For our process, we find that after some time the distribution of wealth settles into a pattern in which most people have only a few dollars, a few are very wealthy, and a single person possesses most of the cash currently present in the population. In addition, eventually the only way to attain first rank is by winning a bet against the current champion. Moreover, if agents play a fair game, i.e., the probability of winning a bet is proportional to the players' fortunes, the title of champion is assumed by every player infinitely often, although it changes less and less frequently as time goes on. Finally, by examining the process from both the perspective of typical fortune, and that of large fortune, we can go one step further and obtain two distinct limiting processes as $n \\to \\infty$, with each one admitting a detailed description of its dynamics.</p><p><strong>Seminar URL</strong>:\u00a0<a href=\"http://u.osu.edu/probability\" title=\"Seminar URL\">http://u.osu.edu/probability</a></p>",

The findings provide support for a methodological approach to the study of racial inequality that is attentive to the multiple perspectives of the actors involved.</p><p>Akwasi Owusu-Bempah BA (Carleton) MA, PhD (Toronto) is an assistant professor in the Department of Sociology at the University of Toronto, Mississauga.\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Owusu-Bempah\u2019s work focuses on the intersections of race, crime and criminal justice, with a particular interest in the area of policing.\u00a0 His current projects include: a study of Black males\u2019 perceptions of and experiences with the police in Greater Toronto Area (including the experiences of both civilians and police officers); and an examination of representations of Blackness in Canadian print media.

Such a theory was developed in the second author's Ph. D thesis for algebraic varieties over a separably closed field in the \u00e9tale setting.</p><p>The present work, joint with Gunnar Carlsson, extends this to a much wider context, for example to varieties over non-separably closed fields in all characteristics and also to both the \u00e9tale and motivic settings. In view of the fact that the most promising application of the traditional transfer has been to Borel-style equivariant cohomology theories, we focus our applications to Borel-style equivariant motivic cohomology theories defined with respect to motivic spectra. We obtain several results in this direction, including a stable splitting in generalized motivic cohomology theories. Various further applications will be discussed in forthcoming papers.</p>",

Tracing the rise to prominence of such phenomena in the PRC, this presentation will examine the ways in which theatrical productions can become performances <em>of </em>technology, setting digital effects and computerized equipment on par with human actors and complicating concepts of live performance, natural landscape, and national culture. It demonstrates that showcasing Chinese innovation has become a central concern of state-sponsored and commercial theatrical productions over the last fifteen years, and argues that success in this domain has established what might be termed an \u201caesthetics of technological excess\u201d as a prominent artistic mode in contemporary Chinese culture. As this new aesthetics dominates China\u2019s main stages, it incites critical responses from more avant-garde corners of the performing arts world and raises theoretical questions regarding the changing nature of spectacle in contemporary China.\u00a0<br><br><strong>Bio</strong>: Tarryn Chun is an Assistant Professor in the department of Film, Television, and Theatre at the University of Notre Dame, where she also holds a concurrent appointment in the department of East Asian Languages and Cultures and is a Faculty Fellow at the Liu Institute for Asia and Asian Studies. Prior to joining the faculty at Notre Dame, she received her PhD from Harvard University and was a postdoctoral fellow in the Lieberthal-Rogel Center for Chinese Studies at the University of Michigan. Her research focuses on modern and contemporary Chinese theatre, and she teaches courses in Asian theatre, global theatre history, intercultural performance, adaptation, and intersections among theatre and other arts/media. Her work has appeared in <em>TDR: The Drama Review, Asian Theatre Journal, Wenxue </em>(Literature),<em> Xiju yishu </em>(Theatre Arts) and the edited volumes <em>Staging China: New Theatres for the Twenty-First Century </em>(Palgrave Macmillan, 2015) and <em>A New Literary History of Modern China </em>(Harvard University Press, 2017). Currently, she is completing a book manuscript entitled <em>Revolutionary Stagecraft: Theatre, Technology, and Media in Modern China</em>, which examines the relationship between technological modernization and artistic innovation in 20th-21st century Chinese theatre. She also serves as Vice-President of the Association for Asian Performance.</p><p><br>\u00a0</p><h2><strong>Free and open to the public</strong></h2><p><br><em>This event made possible in part by OSU\u2019s Department of East Asian Languages and Literatures and by a U.S. Department of Education Title VI grant to The Ohio State University East Asian Studies Center.</em></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br><br>\u00a0</p>",

Similarly, the site-specific \u201creal-scenery performances\u201d (<em>shijing yanchu </em>\u5be6\u666f\u6f14\u51fa) at places like West Lake and Wutai Mountain project swirling patterns and candy-colored lights onto both their audiences and the environments in which they are situated.</p><p>Tracing the rise to prominence of such phenomena in the PRC, this presentation will examine the ways in which theatrical productions can become performances <em>of </em>technology, setting digital effects and computerized equipment on par with human actors and complicating concepts of live performance, natural landscape, and national culture. It demonstrates that showcasing Chinese innovation has become a central concern of state-sponsored and commercial theatrical productions over the last fifteen years, and argues that success in this domain has established what might be termed an \u201caesthetics of technological excess\u201d as a prominent artistic mode in contemporary Chinese culture. As this new aesthetics dominates China\u2019s main stages, it incites critical responses from more avant-garde corners of the performing arts world and raises theoretical questions regarding the changing nature of spectacle in contemporary China.<br><br><strong>Bio</strong>: Forthcoming</p><h2><strong>Free and open to the public</strong></h2><p><br><em>This event is made possible by a U.S. Department of Education Title VI grant to The Ohio State University East Asian Studies Center. </em></p>",

Using these skein relations, one can see that the vector space of all tangles with 2n-boundary points modulo these skein relations is finite dimensional. Furthermore, these knot polynomials are characterized by being the unique ones where the space of 2n-tangles have small dimension for small n. But there's nothing essential here about looking at tangles, instead one could look skein theories for planar trivalent graphs, or knotted trivalent graphs, or any number of other possibilities. I will survey the current landscape of known simple skein theories, which include many striking examples like the exceptional Lie algebra and the Haagerup subfactor, and explain some of the techniques used in such classifications.</p><p><strong>Bio</strong>:\u00a0Noah Snyder is an associate professor at Indiana University. He did his Ph.D. at UC Berkeley with Nicolai Reshetikhin. Afterwards he was an NSF postdoc at Columbia University and a visiting scientist at MPIM. Noah's research focuses on example-driven questions in quantum algebra and quantum topology. He has worked on the classification and structure of small index subfactors, skein theoretic approaches to tensor categories, and local three dimensional topological field theories. Noah has spent nearly a year on the OSU campus at the Ross program.</p><p><strong>Colloquium URL</strong>:\u00a0<a href=\"https://math.osu.edu/activities/colloquium\" title=\"Colloquium URL\">https://math.osu.edu/activities/colloquium</a></p>",

The concert will be followed by a chance to chat informally with our guest.</p><p>Simone Cristicchi (composer, actor, writer) was born in Rome in 1977. His producer is Francesco Migliacci (the son of Franco Migliacci, co-author with Domenico Modugno of the song<em> \u201cVolare - Nel blu dipinto di blu\u201d). </em>During his career he has produced four albums. In March 2007, he won the\u00a0<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Festival_della_canzone_italiana\" title=\"Festival della canzone italiana\">Sanremo music festival</a> (an event that offers many Italian musicians their first shot at widespread success) with his song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8RiA5ZRKMs\" title=\"\">\"Ti regaler\u00f2 una rosa\" (I will give you a rose)</a>. The lyrics to the song are taken from papers he found that were written by a man who was in a mental hospital for most of his life. It is a sad tale of the man's struggle with being away from the woman he loves and being exiled for being mentally ill. The song has so far reached number 3 on the official Italian charts and number 1 one the official downloads chart.</p><p>His most recent production in 2013 was a dramatic musical theater piece <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0bE-0g1gMs.\" title=\"\u201cMagazzino 18\u201d (Warehouse 18)\"><em>\u201cMagazzino 18\u201d (Warehouse 18) </em></a>that was always sold out and ended in standing ovations, but also raised controversies and reflections. The topic of the musical is the forced exodus of the Italian population from Istria, Fiume, and Dalmatia as evidenced by the belongings and the memories of more than 350,000 Italian refugees stored, to this day, in <em>Warehouse 18</em> in the old port of Trieste.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.simonecristicchi.it/\" title=\"Visit Simone\u2019s website.\">Visit Simone\u2019s website.</a></p><p><em>All undergraduate students will receive extra credit for attending this event.

Some believe that persons are obligated by reason or God to promote just institutions, while others locate authority and obligation solely in the self. Rorty tells us that we need not choose between these sources of normativity, but can see each as applicable to two, non-conflicting parts of our lives. I contend that Rorty\u2019s solution rests on a misunderstanding of the upshots of contingency and of the conditions of personhood. I argue that Hegel provides a more compelling resolution of the tension between public obligation and private autonomy.</p><p>Brandon Hogan is an Assistant Professor at Howard University.</p>",

Costume in particular emerged as a powerful tool by which the Ottomans could shape their international image, as exemplified by the famous photographic album of traditional dress that was created for the 1873 Vienna World\u2019s Fair with the intention of demonstrating the empire\u2019s cosmopolitanism and territorial reach. R\u00fcstem's talk will address the impact of such sartorial self-representation as it played out in two museums of Ottoman costume established in the 1850s, one in Istanbul and the other in London. Each consisting of dozens of lifelike mannequins wearing outdated traditional garb, these museums coopted visual strategies associated with Orientalism and repurposed them to present a corrective and positive view of the Ottomans and their culture. At its most effective, this reclaiming of an \u201cOriental\u201d identity underscored, rather than undermined, the Ottoman Empire\u2019s status as a modern world power, though the thematic overlap between these self-assertive sartorial displays and the art of Orientalism presented a continual challenge to their intended message.</p>",

Together they\u2019ll perform live scores for a selection of surreal silent films by artist Man Ray. An Ohio native, Jarmusch visited the Wex in 2001 for a major retrospective of his films. In the early 1980s, he was a member of the New York\u2013based No Wave bands Dark Days and Del-Byzanteens.\n\nMusic has long been central to Jarmusch\u2019s work as a director, and he and Logan, along with other partners, scored his films The Limits of Control (2009), Only Lovers Left Alive (2013), and Paterson (2016). For this project they give free rein to their own sonic impulses to create original music for Man Ray\u2019s entrancing short films, using haunting loops, analogue synthesizers, and treated guitar textures to build semi-improvised, drifting layers of ambient drones to complement the dreamlike images on-screen.\n\nOne of the most inventive artists of the 20th century, Man Ray was a legendary photographer, painter, and maker of objects and films. Born Emmanuel Radnitzky in Philadelphia in 1890, he knew the worlds of Greenwich Village in the avant-garde era following the 1913 Armory Show and Paris in the 1920s and 1930s, where he played a key role in the Dada and Surrealist movements.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been a fan of Man Ray\u2019s work for a long time, and I\u2019ve been interested in Dadaists and Surrealists since my teens,\u201d Jarmusch noted in a 2015 interview. \u201cHe has such beautiful nonlinear experiments in film\u2026In the 1920s, he was hanging the camera out of moving cars, shooting through textured glass, making photograms, there are literary references.

It provides a unique means of interacting with those landscapes while taking researchers into spaces and communities otherwise difficult to reach. Exploration via endurance running also results in a greater attunement to \u201cplaceness\u201d and a more astute interpretation of the person-place relationship in rural spaces. A theoretical and empirical explanation of this unique method of experiencing and interacting with and within place and then applying the resulting more educated phenomenological sensibility to engage rural Japanese social worlds is a contribution of this paper. This method would similarly benefit researchers embedded in other agricultural, rural, or Japanese contexts.</p><p><br><strong>Maki Isaka, University of Minnesota: \u201cContrasting Fates of \u2018Honorary Men\u2019 in Traditional Performing Arts in Modern Japan: Giday\u016b versus Kabuki\u201d</strong></p><p>\u201cTraditional performing arts in modern times\u201d provide an intriguing and productive site for us to analyze twists between premodern- and modern-epistemological paradigms in Japan. This paper examines how gender was being treated in almost-all-male worlds of performing arts as one case study of such. Among the four major traditional performing arts (noh, ky\u014dgen, kabuki, and bunraku puppet theater), this papers uses the following two: kabuki and the story-telling component of bunraku, that is, giday\u016b music. (Performed by a pair of a chanter and a player of shamisen-strings, giday\u016b music provides music, narration, and the voices of all puppets playing theatrical characters onstage.) Contemporary to each other, kabuki and giday\u016b have shared many elements, ranging from scripts (play texts) to performing technique including elocution. Another similarity between the two is that these are all-male arts, with women\u2019s roles performed by male performers, although it does not mean the total absence of female performers. This paper will study how women participants in kabuki and giday\u016b dealt with gender expectation for their performance in the \u201call-male\u201d ethos and standards in kabuki- and giday\u016b-circles, respectively. In particular, this paper examines the contrasting fates of \u201chonorary men,\u201d that is, female performers who mastered masculinized performance style. While female kabuki actors who could pass as male actors ended up being abjected, those female giday\u016b chanters with robust, masculinized chanting style survived, and their immediate predecessors with beautiful feminized chanting style perished.</p><p><br><strong>Michelle Damian, Monmouth College: \u201cMaritime Materiality: Watercraft Refinements in Edo Japan\u201d</strong></p><p>This article argues that the ship construction in Edo-period Japan was often an intentional display of influence and wealth even among workmanlike watercraft. Maritime trade and transport flourished during this time, connecting the urban centers of Osaka and Edo with the farthest reaches of Ezo and Kyushu. The omnipresent nature and variety of styles of boats, from local ferries, to fishing vessels, to large trade ships are recorded diligently in hundreds of woodblock prints by numerous different artists. Careful analysis of the construction styles and contexts of these vessels in the prints, in conjunction with studies of contemporary ships\u2019 treatises and extant artifacts in museum collections, suggests that shipwrights strove to create visually striking watercraft. Evidence shows that certain fishing boats and, in particular, larger trading ships, were also constructed to offer visual cues suggesting a more refined atmosphere or higher status than other utilitarian watercraft. This ostentatiousness helped to reinforce the idea that these were wealthy trading vessels bringing their riches to far-flung ports.\u00a0</p><p>The prominence of watercraft in the visual sources indicates their importance in everyday Edo Japan, and the ships themselves were tangible displays of prestige along their trade routes. Examining the ubiquitous watercraft helps define the subtle ways in which seafarers and cargo owners demonstrated their influence to all who viewed them.<br>\u00a0</p><p><strong>HOTEL:</strong> SpringHill Suites Columbus OSU, located at 1421 Olentangy River Road, Columbus, OH 43212, is about 10 miles from the airport and 2 miles from the OSU campus.

It provides a unique means of interacting with those landscapes while taking researchers into spaces and communities otherwise difficult to reach. Exploration via endurance running also results in a greater attunement to \u201cplaceness\u201d and a more astute interpretation of the person-place relationship in rural spaces. A theoretical and empirical explanation of this unique method of experiencing and interacting with and within place and then applying the resulting more educated phenomenological sensibility to engage rural Japanese social worlds is a contribution of this paper. This method would similarly benefit researchers embedded in other agricultural, rural, or Japanese contexts.</p><p><br><strong>Maki Isaka, University of Minnesota: \u201cContrasting Fates of \u2018Honorary Men\u2019 in Traditional Performing Arts in Modern Japan: Giday\u016b versus Kabuki\u201d</strong></p><p>\u201cTraditional performing arts in modern times\u201d provide an intriguing and productive site for us to analyze twists between premodern- and modern-epistemological paradigms in Japan. This paper examines how gender was being treated in almost-all-male worlds of performing arts as one case study of such. Among the four major traditional performing arts (noh, ky\u014dgen, kabuki, and bunraku puppet theater), this papers uses the following two: kabuki and the story-telling component of bunraku, that is, giday\u016b music. (Performed by a pair of a chanter and a player of shamisen-strings, giday\u016b music provides music, narration, and the voices of all puppets playing theatrical characters onstage.) Contemporary to each other, kabuki and giday\u016b have shared many elements, ranging from scripts (play texts) to performing technique including elocution. Another similarity between the two is that these are all-male arts, with women\u2019s roles performed by male performers, although it does not mean the total absence of female performers. This paper will study how women participants in kabuki and giday\u016b dealt with gender expectation for their performance in the \u201call-male\u201d ethos and standards in kabuki- and giday\u016b-circles, respectively. In particular, this paper examines the contrasting fates of \u201chonorary men,\u201d that is, female performers who mastered masculinized performance style. While female kabuki actors who could pass as male actors ended up being abjected, those female giday\u016b chanters with robust, masculinized chanting style survived, and their immediate predecessors with beautiful feminized chanting style perished.</p><p><br><strong>Michelle Damian, Monmouth College: \u201cMaritime Materiality: Watercraft Refinements in Edo Japan\u201d</strong></p><p>This article argues that the ship construction in Edo-period Japan was often an intentional display of influence and wealth even among workmanlike watercraft. Maritime trade and transport flourished during this time, connecting the urban centers of Osaka and Edo with the farthest reaches of Ezo and Kyushu. The omnipresent nature and variety of styles of boats, from local ferries, to fishing vessels, to large trade ships are recorded diligently in hundreds of woodblock prints by numerous different artists. Careful analysis of the construction styles and contexts of these vessels in the prints, in conjunction with studies of contemporary ships\u2019 treatises and extant artifacts in museum collections, suggests that shipwrights strove to create visually striking watercraft. Evidence shows that certain fishing boats and, in particular, larger trading ships, were also constructed to offer visual cues suggesting a more refined atmosphere or higher status than other utilitarian watercraft. This ostentatiousness helped to reinforce the idea that these were wealthy trading vessels bringing their riches to far-flung ports.\u00a0</p><p>The prominence of watercraft in the visual sources indicates their importance in everyday Edo Japan, and the ships themselves were tangible displays of prestige along their trade routes. Examining the ubiquitous watercraft helps define the subtle ways in which seafarers and cargo owners demonstrated their influence to all who viewed them.<br>\u00a0</p><p><strong>HOTEL:</strong> SpringHill Suites Columbus OSU, located at 1421 Olentangy River Road, Columbus, OH 43212, is about 10 miles from the airport and 2 miles from the OSU campus.

        "content": "<p>Michelle Ellsworth will be working with the <a href=\"http://www.humanetechosu.org/\">Humane Tech</a> group November 5-9 and doing an Artist Talk in <a href=\"https://dance.osu.edu/people/zuniga-shaw.1\">Norah Zuniga-Shaw's </a>intermedia class that is open to you and your students. She is a powerful choreographer and solo artist using a mix of technology, dance, theater, and humor to engage themes of contemporary relevance.</p><p><strong>This is a free event, but <a href=\"https://dance.osu.edu/rsvp-artist-talk-and-solo-performance-workshop-michelle_elssworth\">please RSVP&gt;&gt;&gt;</a></strong><br><br><strong><em>Post-Verbal Social Network (PVSN)</em></strong>\u00a0employs pre-industrial technologies to augment the physical labor of choreography and community. Simple mechanical apparatuses (built into costumes and shoes) will comingle with choreography to: 1) extend dancers\u2019 bodies and functions, and 2) illuminate how contemporary digital technology is impacting our bodies and our social interactions.\u00a0<em>PVSN\u00a0</em>will remind us what a physically productive, collaborative, non-language based, non-mediated, pre-industrial, human-to-human, 3D encounter looks and feels like. That said...a web app accompanies the piece.</p><p><strong><em>Clytemnestra\u2019s Guide to Surveillance-Free Living</em></strong><br>Across multiple web platforms, this so-called \u201cwork\u201d will demonstrate several \u201cover-the-counter counter-terrorism\u201d protocols for avoiding surveillance and interpersonal drama. \u201cResearch\u201d tells us that the most dangerous data collection systems are: 1) The internet (its purpose is to share and save information\u2014even when you don\u2019t want it to) and 2) Humans (they are often listening and consistently insecure). With a bit of JavaScript and the remixing of an ancient Homeric text, these two problems can be contained, and exposure to unstable \u201cwatching\u201d can be avoided. Based on the latest so-called \u201cimportant\u201d ideas in neuroscience, linguistics, anthropology, and the Trump-centric geopolitical reality, this work is informed by Claude Levi-Strauss, Giorgio Agamben, Kellyanne Conway, Judith Butler, Vladislav Surkov, and \u00a0Vilayanur Ramachandran.</p><p><strong>The Rehearsal Artist</strong><br>In a rehearsal studio-turned-laboratory, a small group of audience members peep through a one-way mirror at a performer responding to choreographic instructions, derived from the canon of social science experiments. \u00a0As the audience\u2019s perception shifts and extends, this iterative and playful performance amplifies and destabilizes the act of watching.</p><p><strong>Bio</strong><br>Among Michelle Ellsworth\u2019s honors are a Guggenheim Fellowship (2016), Doris Duke Impact Award (2015), a NEFA National Dance Project Grant (2014 and 2017), a Creative Capital Fellowship (2013), and a USA Artists Knight Fellowship in Dance (2012). She has received three National Performance Network Creation Fund Commissions (2004, 2007, and 2016).</p><p>Though not a licensed scientist, technologist, or carpenter, Ellsworth nevertheless co-mingles these disciplines with dance in an attempt to choreograph coping strategies and wood-based and web-based solutions, and also to demonstrate some peculiar geopolitical (and personal) phenomena. The pharmaceutical and political potential of dance interests her, as well as the value of broken and labor-intensive ideas.</p><p>Highlights in her performing career include presenting at Bard\u2019s Fisher Center (2017), Noorderzon Festival (Netherlands 2016), Made in the U.S.A Festival (Greece 2016), On The Boards (2004, 2005, 2012, 2015), The Chocolate Factory (2015), The Fusebox Festival \u00a0(2013 and 2015), Brown University (2011, 2015), Abandon Normal Devices Festival (Liverpool 2013), Danspace in New York City (2012), Diverseworks in Houston (1996, 1997, 2001, 2005, 2009), and Dance Theatre Workshop in New York City (1992, 1993, 1996, 2007).</p>",

In each country the ensuing debates over the truth about how human beings are took unique form. Only in West Germany did\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 debates about the value of psychoanalysis as a system of thought circle so intensely around the question of whether or not aggression was an ineradicable aspect of the human animal and whether or not it might best be conceived as a \u201cdrive\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 comparable in strength and form to libido. This paper analyzes the wholly unexpected consequences set in motion by the publication of ethologist Konrad Lorenz\u2019s <em>On Aggression</em>, not only on the oeuvre of the preeminent West German psycho- analyst Alexander Mitscherlich, but also on the eventual shape taken by the New Left\u2019s politics and theories of human nature. The talk discusses how difficult it was to return psychoanalysis to a country in which antisemitism was still strong. It also discusses how dramatically the West German sexual revolution changed the terms of debate about the relationships between aggression and libido.</p><p><strong>Dagmar Herzog</strong> is Distinguished Professor of History and Daniel Rose Faculty Scholar at the Graduate Center, City University of New York. She has published extensively on the history of religion, the history of the Holocaust and its aftermath, and the histories of gender and sexuality. Among her books are <em>Sex after Fascism: Memory and Morality in Twentieth-Century Germany</em> (2005) and <em>Sexuality in Europe: A Twentieth-Century History</em> (2011). She has just published a transatlantic history of psychoanalysis in the postwar era, with particular attention to the themes of desire, trauma, and aggression, entitled <em>Cold War Freud: Psychoanalysis in an Age of Catastrophes</em> (2017) and is preparing a new project on eugenics, disability, and reproductive self-determination in twentieth-century Europe.</p><p>Sponsored by the <a href=\"https://germanic.osu.edu/about-us/luebeck-history\">Carolyn Engel Luebeck Fund</a> and Germanic Languages and Literatures.</p><p>\u00a0</p>",

Please register <a href=\"http://go.osu.edu/FitzGeraldRegistration\" title=\"Event registration\">here</a>.</h3><p><br><strong>Abstract:\u00a0</strong>Until the 20th century, religion was a great part of American intellectual life. It was deeply ingrained into the educational system from primary school to university. It was the stuff of philosophy and \u201cnatural science.\u201d Only when universities adopted the German model of dividing scholarship into separate disciplines, and purging the supernatural from the natural was religion forced to retreat to the departments of theology. Today American history books and textbooks say so little about religion that students could believe we always lived in a secular society. That is hardly the case. For most of the 19th century evangelical Protestantism dominated American culture and society. My talk will be about how evangelicals influenced 19th century history, the split within the movement that led to the culture wars of the 20th century, and the future of evangelicals in 21st century politics.\u00a0</p><p>Frances FitzGerald's newest book, <em>The Evangelicals: The Struggle to Shape America</em>, was published on April 4, 2017 and is a definitive history of the evangelical movement, its central figures, and its long-reaching influence upon American history, politics, and culture.</p><p>FitzGerald's talk will be followed by a panel discussion that will be moderated by\u00a0<a href=\"https://polisci.osu.edu/people/beck.9\" title=\"Paul Beck's webpage\">Paul Beck</a>\u00a0(Political Science, Ohio State).

For example any o-minimal theory is distal and any stable theory is non-distal. Distal theories usually include some sort of ordering. However, algebraically closed valued fields are non-distal, as the structure on the residue field is stable. The class of distal theories is not closed under reducts, but some useful consequences of distality do pass to reducts. Thus, even for a non-distal structure, the question of whether it can be expanded to a distal structure is of interest. In this talk, I will survey what is known about distality and distal expansions in the context of expansions of the reals.</p>",

In this talk I will focus on Bayesian approaches to learning in the context of inverse problems on unknown domains and in particular semi-supervised learning. More specifically, we consider the problem of recovering a function input of a partial differential equation formulated on an unknown manifold $M$ where we can define a ground-truth Bayesian inverse problem. We assume to have access to a discrete domain $M_n = \\{x_1, ... , x_n\\} \\subset M$, and to noisy measurements of the output solution at $p \\leq n$ of those points. The discrete domain is then endowed with a graph structure which is used to create a graph surrogate for the ground-truth Bayesian inverse problem. The first theoretical result that I will present establishes the convergence of the graph posterior distribution associated to the graph-Bayesian inverse problem towards its ground-truth counterpart as the number of unlabeled data points converges to infinity. Our analysis relies on the variational description of posterior distributions, the choice of an appropriate topology to compare distributions on different domains, and precise quantitative estimates of the spectrum of graph Laplacians. I will then show that our consistency results have profound algorithmic implications: when they hold, carefully designed graph-based Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms have a uniform spectral gap, independent of the number of unlabeled data. Several numerical experiments corroborate both the statistical consistency and the algorithmic scalability, and pave the way for future theoretical developments in the area of robust uncertainty quantification for machine learning tasks. This talk is based on works with Zachary Kaplan, Thabo Samakhoana, and Daniel Sanz-Alonso.</p><p><strong>Seminar URL</strong>:\u00a0<a href=\"https://research.math.osu.edu/tgda/tgda-seminar.html\" title=\"Seminar URL\">https://research.math.osu.edu/tgda/tgda-seminar.html</a></p>",

She is a powerful choreographer and solo artist using a mix of technology, dance, theater, and humor to engage themes of contemporary relevance.</p><p><strong>This is a free event, but <a href=\"https://dance.osu.edu/rsvp-artist-talk-and-solo-performance-workshop-michelle_elssworth\">please RSVP&gt;&gt;&gt;</a></strong></p><p><em>Post-Verbal Social Network (PVSN)</em>\u00a0employs pre-industrial technologies to augment the physical labor of choreography and community. Simple mechanical apparatuses (built into costumes and shoes) will comingle with choreography to: 1) extend dancers\u2019 bodies and functions, and 2) illuminate how contemporary digital technology is impacting our bodies and our social interactions.\u00a0<em>PVSN\u00a0</em>will remind us what a physically productive, collaborative, non-language based, non-mediated, pre-industrial, human-to-human, 3D encounter looks and feels like. That said...a web app accompanies the piece.</p><p><em>Clytemnestra\u2019s Guide to Surveillance-Free Living</em><br>Across multiple web platforms, this so-called \u201cwork\u201d will demonstrate several \u201cover-the-counter counter-terrorism\u201d protocols for avoiding surveillance and interpersonal drama. \u201cResearch\u201d tells us that the most dangerous data collection systems are: 1) The internet (its purpose is to share and save information\u2014even when you don\u2019t want it to) and 2) Humans (they are often listening and consistently insecure). With a bit of JavaScript and the remixing of an ancient Homeric text, these two problems can be contained, and exposure to unstable \u201cwatching\u201d can be avoided. Based on the latest so-called \u201cimportant\u201d ideas in neuroscience, linguistics, anthropology, and the Trump-centric geopolitical reality, this work is informed by Claude Levi-Strauss, Giorgio Agamben, Kellyanne Conway, Judith Butler, Vladislav Surkov, and \u00a0Vilayanur Ramachandran.</p><p>The Rehearsal Artist<br>In a rehearsal studio-turned-laboratory, a small group of audience members peep through a one-way mirror at a performer responding to choreographic instructions, derived from the canon of social science experiments. \u00a0As the audience\u2019s perception shifts and extends, this iterative and playful performance amplifies and destabilizes the act of watching.</p><p>Bio<br>Among Michelle Ellsworth\u2019s honors are a Guggenheim Fellowship (2016), Doris Duke Impact Award (2015), a NEFA National Dance Project Grant (2014 and 2017), a Creative Capital Fellowship (2013), and a USA Artists Knight Fellowship in Dance (2012). She has received three National Performance Network Creation Fund Commissions (2004, 2007, and 2016).</p><p>Though not a licensed scientist, technologist, or carpenter, Ellsworth nevertheless co-mingles these disciplines with dance in an attempt to choreograph coping strategies and wood-based and web-based solutions, and also to demonstrate some peculiar geopolitical (and personal) phenomena. The pharmaceutical and political potential of dance interests her, as well as the value of broken and labor-intensive ideas.</p><p>Highlights in her performing career include presenting at Bard\u2019s Fisher Center (2017), Noorderzon Festival (Netherlands 2016), Made in the U.S.A Festival (Greece 2016), On The Boards (2004, 2005, 2012, 2015), The Chocolate Factory (2015), The Fusebox Festival \u00a0(2013 and 2015), Brown University (2011, 2015), Abandon Normal Devices Festival (Liverpool 2013), Danspace in New York City (2012), Diverseworks in Houston (1996, 1997, 2001, 2005, 2009), and Dance Theatre Workshop in New York City (1992, 1993, 1996, 2007).</p>",

        "content": "<p>A lecture by <strong>Emily Neumeier</strong>, ACLS Postdoctoral Fellow, The Ohio State University</p><p>The discussion of religious architecture in Islamic art history remains resolutely focused on the mosque\u2014the central gathering space for Muslim prayer. Such a view, however, obscures the presence of non-Muslim communities, particularly Christians, who were often a significant minority living under Islamic rule. This talk investigates how one provincial governor from the Ottoman Empire, Tepedelenli Ali Pasha (r. 1784-1822), proved adept at soliciting the support of these multiple confessional groups through the patronage of architecture. Most significantly, Neumeier lays out archival and epigraphic evidence to reveal that Ali Pasha himself commissioned a monastic church complex in what is now southern Albania. By comparing this monument with other religious foundations funded by the governor\u2014from mosques to dervish lodges\u2014she posits a multi-confessional history of Islamic architecture, which can be written on the periphery of empire.</p>",

For any complete, conformal metric $g$ on $M$ such that $Q_g$ is identically $1$ or $0$ and $R_g$ nonnegative, $g$ has to be symmetric with respect to rotations of $S^n$ leaving $S^l$ invariant.</p><p>This theorem is a corollary of the following more general</p><p>Theorem: Let $g$ be a conformal, complete metric on a domain $D$ in $S^n$ such that the above curvature conditions are satisfied.

In this talk, we provide a brief background to sparsity and 1-bit measurements, and then present new results on the problem of data classification from binary data that proposes a framework with low computation and resource costs. We illustrate the utility of the proposed approach through stylized and realistic numerical experiments, provide a theoretical analysis for a simple case, and discuss future directions.</p><p><strong>Bio</strong>: Deanna Needell earned her PhD from UC Davis before working as a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford University.

        "content": "<p>In this talk, Dr. Lewis Cusato analyzes how globalization affects cultural production and reception, especially in the context of francophone North Africa. This project specifically considers the case of Malika Oufkir and Mich\u00e8le Fitoussi's Stolen Lives: Twenty Years in a Desert Jail, which was chosen for Oprah's Book Club in 2001. By comparing the marketing strategies and paratexts associated with the French and American versions of the book, we can learn much about the transnational movements of postcolonial Maghrebi cultural icons, and the ways their representations, reception, and meanings shift when they travel. \"From Morocco to Oprah\" reads Oufkir's tale alongside some of the most prominent ways that globalization inserts itself into cultural production and interpretation alike.</p><p><strong>Dr. Lewis Cusato is the Assistant Professor and Assistant Director of the Global Studies Institute at Ohio Wesleyan University.</strong></p><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/429907174078496\" title=\"Connect with the event on Facebook\">Connect with the event on Facebook</a></strong></p>",

She received her Ph.D. from the University of Chicago where she researched the history and philosophy of education in museum settings. Much of her work in recent years has centered on developing unorthodox ways of connecting people to the natural world, with a special interest in artistic and technological media. She\u2019s the former director of Garfield and Lincoln Park Conservatories in Chicago and spent the early part of her career at the Chicago Botanic Garden and the Field Museum of Natural History. Since 2006 she has been an independent consultant to museums, gardens, parks and nonprofit organizations. She has written and lectured widely about a range of subjects related to the public dimension of museums and is currently an adjunct professor at Johns Hopkins University. She is a member of the editorial board of the journal Museums and Social Issues and has served as an advisor to a variety of civic and community organizations over the years.</p><p><strong>Student Lunch</strong><br>11:30pm-1:00pm<br>Folklore Archives</p><p>Details forthcoming.</p><p><strong>Lecture:\u00a0Making a Living as a Museum FanGirl</strong><br>2:00pm-4:00pm<br>Denney Hall 311</p><p>What happens when you love reading and writing and studying and thinking and a few years go by and you find yourself in a phd program but you don\u2019t really want to make the university your life\u2019s work? In Lisa Roberts\u2019s case (and yes, that extra \u201cs\u201d after the apostrophe is correct\u2014I learned it in grad school), you make your way to another behemoth of an institution, The Museum. Lisa has worked for a number of types of museums wearing a variety of different hats. Hers has been a circuitous path, from chemistry to philosophy of science, cabinets of curiosity to museums, knowledge to narrative. There's a train of thought there, driven by an interest in how people make meaning. But how do you make a living out of that? That\u2019s what we\u2019re going to talk about.</p>",

Persistent homology is one of the important tools in topological data analysis and it characterizes shapes of data. In particular, it provides a tool called the persistence diagram that extracts multiscale topological features such as rings and cavities in data (e.g. atomic configurations, high dimensional digital images etc).</p><p>Talk 1, I show a recent result about convergence of persistence diagrams on stationary point process in R^N.

        "content": "<p><strong>The U.S. Labor Market and Deaths of Despair</strong></p><p>The United States is currently facing an epidemic of opioid overdose deaths. Twelve and a half million Americans reported misusing prescription opioids and 78 people died per day from opioid overdoses in 2016 (USDHHS 2017). Overdose deaths are concentrated most heavily among those with a high school degree or less (Case and Deaton 2015). While supply side factors, such as the availability of prescription opioids and heroin have likely played a role in this trend, the fact that suicide and liver failure deaths have also increased sharply over the same timeframe suggests broader societal changes may be influencing demand for such powerful drugs. One idea is that declining economic opportunity, especially for those with a high school degree or less, has increased the demand for opioids and increased the intensity with which this population engages in self-harm activities.</p><p>Previous work has chronicled the disappearance of so-called middle-skill jobs in the United States that have historically supported middle-class workers with less than a college degree (Autor 2010). Other studies have found both mental health and drug use to be countercyclical, with higher unemployment rates resulting in worse mental health and drug use outcomes (Hollingworth et al. 2017; Carpenter et al. 2017; Rhum 2015; Arkes 2007); however, to date no empirical study has identified a causal link between industry shifts for low-skill and mid-skill workers and opioid use.</p><p>We test whether these declines in middle skill jobs and increases in deaths of despair are related by examining whether county-level changes in wages given a county\u2019s industry structure are connected to increases in overdose deaths, suicides, and liver disease deaths between 1999-2014. Using a Bartik (1991) instrument, we exploit exogenous industry-specific wage shocks that affect some counties and groups more severely than others. This approach provides causal evidence to the ongoing debate about the causes of the opioid crisis. Because local economic conditions factor differently into an individual\u2019s outlook across the lifespan, we test for differences in the relationship between local economic conditions and deaths of despair rates for different age cohorts and racial groups. We find that places that experienced exogenous wage shocks experienced higher overdose and suicide rates during the 1999-2014 period, with significant variation across different demographics and the rural/urban hierarchy.</p>",

Persistent homology is one of the important tools in topological data analysis and it characterizes shapes of data. In particular, it provides a tool called the persistence diagram that extracts multiscale topological features such as rings and cavities in data (e.g. atomic configurations, high dimensional digital images etc).</p><p><a href=\"https://math.osu.edu/events/topology-geometry-and-data-mini-course-yasu-hiraoka\" title=\"TGDA Mini-Course Talk 1\">Talk 1</a>, I show a recent result about convergence of persistence diagrams on stationary point process in R^N. Several limit theorems such as strong laws of large numbers and central limit theorems for random cubical homology are also shown here.</p><p><a href=\"https://math.osu.edu/events/topology-geometry-and-data-mini-course-yasu-hiraoka-0\" title=\"TGDA Mini-Course Talk 2\">Talk 2</a>, I discuss a higher dimensional generalization of Frieze\u2019s zeta(3) theorem on the Linial-Meshulam process and the clique complex process. The key observation is to show a connection of the minimum spanning acycle to the lifetime of persistent homology.</p><p>Talk 3, I switch to the application of persistent homology to materials science. Here, I will summarize several recent activities about machine learnings on persistent homology.

The Linial--Meshulam complex process and the clique complex process were studied by Hiraoka and Shirai. They showed the exact order of the expected lifetime sum of the Betti numbers for the Linial--Meshulam complex process as the number of vertices goes to infinity. In this talk, I define more general random simplicial complex processes, including the above two models, and report that the exact order of the expected lifetime sum for them was revealed. The key to proving the results is a quantitative generalization of the Cohomology vanishing theorem. This is joint work with Masanori Hino.</p><p><strong>Seminar URL</strong>:\u00a0<a href=\"https://math.osu.edu/event-terms-1/seminar-combinatorics\" title=\"Seminar URL\">https://math.osu.edu/event-terms-1/seminar-combinatorics</a></p>",

The canonical situation is given by a field net of von Neumann algebras equipped with a global gauge action, extending its gauge invariant subnet (observable part of the theory). In the mathematical literature the main interest is on finite index subfactors. At the same time, finite index extensions are covered on the QFT side.</p><p>We report on a generalization of this analysis to the infinite index case (e.g. compact non-finite gauge groups) and show how QFTs with defects can be constructed. The main technical is tool is the notion of generalized Q-system (adapting Longo\u2019s Q-systems to the infinite index setting) and the more special generalized Q-systems of intertwiners which characterize discrete inclusions among the semidiscrete ones (inclusions with a normal faithful conditional expectation).

For decades we have focused on pushing technique\u2019s resolution close to the physical limits, almost to the point where it has become commoditized. While high resolution is necessary to develop emerging energy materials, multimodality sensing and functionality are univocally more valuable. This presentation will cover recent results in the polycrystalline CuInGaSe2 system and show that the key lies in the multimodal evaluation of the device under operating conditions and the kinetics that govern compositional inhomogeneities. \u00a0</p>\n\n<h3>Bio</h3>\n\n<p>Professor Bertoni received her PhD from Northwestern University in 2007 in Materials Science and Engineering with a minor in Chemistry. She joined ASU as an Assistant Professor in 2012. Prior to this, she held senior scientist positions at two emerging start-up firms in the photovoltaic industry and a visiting scientist appointment at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (2010-2012). Her previous postgraduate experience includes a postdoctoral appointment at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (2008-2010), a Marie Curie postdoctoral fellowship at Creavis Technologies &amp; Innovation in Germany (2007-2008) and a visiting researcher appointment at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. She has published over 60 research articles in peer-reviewed journals, and presented more than 120 papers at scientific meetings. She has received multiple awards and recognitions, including most recently selection to the National Academy of Engineering 2017 US Frontiers of Engineering and ASU\u2019s 2016 Outstanding Assistant Professor.\u00a0 She currently serves at the Advanced Photon Source MBA upgrade user board and is active in various committees and chairing positions at the IEEE photovoltaic specialists conferences.</p>\n",

Founded in 1946 and 1957 respectively, these two ensembles combine to present joint concerts on their national tours. They have performed in all 50 states and 30 foreign countries for audiences totaling hundreds of millions.\u00a0 \u2022\u00a0 The 65-member Concert Band and 29-member Soldiers\u2019 Chorus perform regularly in some of the most famous concert halls in the world, and just as often in the humblest auditoriums in the smallest of communities. The joining of these two ensembles allows them to offer unparalleled versatility of programming, ranging from orchestral masterworks and operatic arias to Sousa marches, jazz classics and Broadway musicals. The band and chorus also perform independently, and have recently shared the stage with such ensembles as the Boston Pops, the Cincinnati Pops, the Detroit Symphony Orchestra and the National Symphony Orchestra.\u00a0 \u2022\u00a0 In addition to their national tours, formal concerts, chamber recitals and educational outreach, members of the Concert Band &amp; Soldiers\u2019 Chorus frequently represent the Army at formal and ceremonial functions, including the Presidential Inaugural Parade, presidential funerals, the Army All-American Bowl and diplomatic efforts overseas.</p>\n<p>Listen to <a href=\"http://www.armyfieldband.com/media/music/promo/stars_and_stripes.mp3\" title=\"USAFB plays \">\"</a><strong><a href=\"http://www.armyfieldband.com/media/music/promo/stars_and_stripes.mp3\" title=\"Listen to the ensembles performing \">Stars and Stripes Forever</a></strong><a href=\"http://www.armyfieldband.com/media/music/promo/stars_and_stripes.mp3\" title=\"Listen to the ensembles performing \">\" [mp3]</a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n",

The focus of Hoffmann's presentation will be the idea of exhibition-making as a <em>dramaturgy of information</em> beyond the display and configurations of objects in a gallery space. The talk will revolve around two historically path-breaking exhibitions, <strong>Primary Structures</strong> (New York, 1966) and <strong>When Attitudes Become Form</strong> (Bern, 1969), both of which Hoffmann explored through staging adaptations of these iconic exhibitions many decades after their original manifestations.</p><p><strong>Jens Hoffmann</strong> is a writer and exhibition-maker based in New York.

        "content": "<p>Antarctica is fringed by floating shelves of ice, fed by the continental glaciers, continuously spreading outward under their own weight as they are melted by the ocean from below. As ice shelves grow, their thin edges become less able to withstand the stresses of ocean circulation and tides. A crack then forms, propagates across the shelf, and detaches an iceberg, returning the ice shelf to stability. This process of iceberg calving, along with basal melt, is the mechanism by which snowfall over the Antarctic interior is balanced by ice loss to the ocean. The periodic calving of large icebergs, therefore, represents a normal pruning of the ice margin; a process that would occur under any climate scenario.</p><p>Besides just passively draining ice to the ocean, however, ice shelves also play a critical role in regulating the flow of the glaciers that feed them. As ice shelves spread outward, they may contact islands and other obstructions that resist their flow. This resistance is transferred back to the glaciers, slowing their flow and causing them to thicken. Thus, ice shelves can also be viewed as dams, regulating the outflow of the Earth\u2019s largest freshwater reservoir. Removal of these dams and the buttressing they provide would cause the glaciers behind them to flow faster, analogous to the opening of a spillway. Additionally, since the Antarctica\u2019s bedrock is isostatically depressed and, therefore, increases in depth toward the interior, this process can initiate runaway glacier retreat through a feedback loop with outflow, a process termed the marine ice sheet instability. The implication is that accelerated ice shelf calving, if occurring where significant buttressing stress is generated, may trigger a sustained period of rapid deglaciation. Evidence of such events exist in the glacial sedimentological record of the Antarctic continental shelf.</p><p>With this understanding of the functions of ice shelves we assess their current state, near-future prognosis and implications for ice sheet stability. Ice shelves are now observed with increasing detail from space, with an effective record spanning approximately two decades. These observations reveal processes both expected, such as the recent calving of the large A68 iceberg from the Larsen C ice shelf, and unexpected, including the meltwater-induced 2002 collapse of the Larsen B and the interior \u201cinside-out\u201d rifting of the Pine Island Glacier. Observations of ice shelf dynamics are coupled with improved mapping of ice sheet bedrock topography, allowing us to pinpoint the glaciers with the greatest potential for instability and construct numerical ice flow models to predict their behavior. Most elusive, however, \u00a0is the deep ocean, for which remote sensing provides much less data and for which predictions of future change remains the most uncertain. On timescales relevant to society, it is likely the ocean and its interaction with ice shelves that will determine the pace of Antarctica\u2019s continued deglaciation.</p>",

This timely symposium offers an opportunity to build and enhance scholarship on democratic citizenship, civic engagement, democratic inclusion, and the overall health of our democracy.</p><p><strong>Day 1, on Thursday, November 30th, a public forum will be held in Saxbe Auditorium (130 Drinko Hall)</strong>, featuring a highly interactive, moderated discussion with several invited speakers. The speakers will discuss the unique features of the new American electorate, including tracing the historical developments which paved the way for these voters to play such pivotal roles in recent presidential elections and recent attempts to curtail the expanding electorate. The forum will be followed by a book signing.</p><p><strong>Day 2, on Friday, December 1st in 120 Mershon Center</strong>, will feature three panels of invited scholars and OSU researchers, who will each focus on one of the following themes:</p><ol>\n<li>Mobilizing in the Interim (focusing on the critical challenges of sustaining civic engagement among new or low propensity voters),</li>\n<li>Moving from Voters to Candidates (examining the long term strategies needed to move habitual voters into the political leadership pipeline as candidates, political strategists, and community members), and</li>\n<li>Lessons from the Field (engaging with specialists in the field who will share existing best practices for moving beyond simply mobilizing new voters to building sustained civic participation).</li>\n</ol><p>\u00a0</p><p>Please visit <a href=\"http://go.osu.edu/2017NewAmericanElectorate\" title=\"Symposium event page on Eventbrite.com.\">Eventbrite.com</a>\u00a0to reserve your seat for one or both days of the symposium.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><em>*Breakfast and lunch will be provided for registrants.</em></p>",

A member of the faculty since 2006, Prof. Gaudi is a leader in the discovery and statistical characterization of extrasolar planets using a variety of methods, including transits and gravitational microlensing.</p><p></p><p>In 2008, he and his collaborators announced the discovery of the first Jupiter/Saturn analog. Prof. Gaudi is deeply immersed in analytic and numerical techniques for assessing the yield, biases, and discovery potential of current and next generation surveys to determine the demographics of exoplanets. Prof. Gaudi is a member of the Formulation Science Working Group for NASA\u2019s Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST), and is the chair of NASA's Astrophysics Advisory Council. Prof. Gaudi was the 2009 recipient of the Helen B. Warner Prize of the American Astronomical Society and won an NSF CAREER Award and Presidential Early Career Award in Science and Engineering (PECASE), the highest honor bestowed by the United States Government on science and engineering professionals in the early stages of their independent research careers.</p><p>This talk is part of the OSAA\u00a0<a href=\"https://astronomy.osu.edu/outreach/public-lecture-series\">Public Lecture Series</a>.

The focus of the book is not on the success or failure of the revolution, but rather on the transformative effect that revolution has on people and what they learn from it.</p><p><strong>Bio</strong>: Xiaowei Zheng is an associate professor of History and EALCS at University of California at Santa Barbara. Her research interests include local history of the Qing dynasty and early republican political culture, with a special focus on the emergence of popular nationalism and the potential of republicanism. She also researches and writes on comparative revolutions, the historiography of constitutionalism and democracy, and critical theory.</p><h2><strong>Free and Open to the Public </strong></h2><p><br><em>This event is made possible by OSU's Department of History and by a U.S. Department of Education Title VI grant to The Ohio State University East Asian Studies Center. </em><br>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><h2>\u00a0</h2>",

He is a specialist on the history of the abbey of Cluny.\u00a0 His first book, <a href=\"http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/history/european-history-1000-1450/silence-and-sign-language-medieval-monasticism-cluniac-tradition-c9001200?format=PB\"> Silence and Sign Language in Medieval Monasticism: The Cluniac Tradition (c. 900-1200</a>)\u00a0was published in 2007 by Cambridge University Press (UK). This book explores the rationales for religious silence in early medieval abbeys and the use of nonverbal forms of communication among monks when rules of silence forbade them from speaking. His second monograph, <a href=\"http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/?GCOI=80140100575220\">Cluny and the Muslims of La Garde-Freinet: Hagiography and the Problem of Islam in Medieval Europe</a>, was published by Cornell University Press in 2015. This book is a study of the representation of the Muslims of La Garde-Freinet in Cluniac hagiography in the eleventh century and the influence of these depictions on polemical works written against Islam by Abbot Peter the Venerable of Cluny in the twelfth century. Professor Bruce has recently translated a collection of medieval Latin ghost stories for Penguin Classics: <a href=\"http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/318729/the-penguin-book-of-the-undead-by-edited-by-scott-g-bruce/9780143107682/\">The Penguin Book of the Undead: Fifteen Hundred Years of Supernatural Encounters from the Romans to the Renaissance</a>.\u00a0His new book, <a href=\"http://www.brepols.net/Pages/ShowProduct.aspx?prod_id=IS-9782503568270-1\">The Relatio metrica de duobus ducibus: A Twelfth-Century Cluniac Poem on Prayer for the Dead</a> (co-authored with Christopher A. Jones)\u00a0will be published by Brepols this winter.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Reception: Wednesday, December 6<br>Admission is free and open to the public</p><p><em>Trans-species Skins\u00a0</em>is a themed art exhibition exploring skin as a metaphor and substance that transcends species categories. Skin is the multilayered and multipurpose organ that shifts from thick to thin, tight to loose, wet to dry, across the landscapes of bodies and machine interfaces. Natural and artificial skin responds to heat, cold, pleasure and pain. It lacks boundaries and flows seamlessly from exposed surfaces to our internal cavities real and virtual. It is a self-repairing, semi-permeable surface, with inner layers that are flush with nerves and glands, sensors and chips. New tools allow artists, designers, and engineers to look at a new emerging organicism that takes shape across the surface of the grown and manufactured. Skins can modulate meaning, touch, function and can provide feedback and change with light and heat. Flexible membranes embedded with sensors and materials are bent, impregnated, or inflated to become structure. Re-skinning allows deceit; the non-living can approximate life, and the living can appear otherwise.</p>*The theme and writing were inspired and paraphrased from Skin, by Ellen Lipton",

I will discuss our\u00a0recent biochemical work describing\u00a0the domain architecture for the Chd1 remodeler on\u00a0the nucleosome. In contrast with what has been described for other remodelers,\u00a0this domain\u00a0organization suggests an inhibitory mechanism for sensing DNA\u00a0flanking the nucleosome. I will present a model for how domain-domain\u00a0communication allows Chd1 to slide nucleosomes away from bound transcription\u00a0factors and generate evenly spaced nucleosome arrays.</p>",

In general, this is a mysterious object. Locally, we can study deformations of complex structures using Kodaira-Spencer theory. However, the global geometry can be very complicated and have singularities. In this talk, we consider the case where we have a Riemannian-flat metric and show how this can be used to understand the geometry of the moduli space. From here, we lay out some conjectures about how this can be done more generally, and give some heuristic evidence for these conjectures.</p><p><strong>Seminar URL</strong>:\u00a0<a href=\"https://research.math.osu.edu/agseminar/\" title=\"Seminar URL\">https://research.math.osu.edu/agseminar/</a></p>",

        "content": "<p>Ruthenates with perovskite and perovskite-related structures host a remarkably diverse class of exotic quantum phases ranging from spin-triplet superconductivity, ferromagnetism, metamagnetism, spin-density waves, antiferromagnetism, and quantum criticality\u2014all with the same basic building block of corner-sharing RuO6 octahedra containing Ru4+ ions.\u00a0 We exploit strain engineering1 to tune the band structure of the complex oxide ruthenates:\u00a0 CaRuO3,2,3 SrRuO3,3,4 and BaRuO3,5 with the perovskite structure as well as their two-dimensional counterparts Sr2RuO4 and Ba2RuO4.6\u00a0 The ruthenate films are grown by reactive molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE) and the misfit strain is imposed by underlying substrates to strain these complex oxide thin films to percent levels3\u2014far beyond where they would crack or plastically deform in bulk.\u00a0 The band structure is revealed by high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) on pristine as-grown surfaces of these complex oxides made possible by a direct ultra-high vacuum connection between the MBE and ARPES.\u00a0 Our work demonstrates the possibilities for utilizing strain engineering as a disorder-free means to manipulate emergent properties and many-body interactions in correlated materials.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Lecture Title: Rethinking Gender and Language in Stephen Scrope's Epistle of Othea</p><p>Abstract: For decades the scholarly consensus about Stephen Scrope\u2019s translation of Christine de Pizan\u2019s Epistre Othea has asserted that it is a precise translation of her work but that he must have held some antifeminist positions because he denies Christine recognition as author, and he inexplicably genders as masculine multiple women from classical mythology. Yet a thorough examination of all three manuscripts and the closest extant manuscript to Scrope\u2019s source challenges these views. Even though these copies are affected by scribal variants, as a whole, these manuscripts provide a fuller picture of Scrope\u2019s process as translator and his difficulties grappling with the complexity not only of Christine\u2019s often-unexpected perspectives but also of her language itself and even some of the classical myths that structure her work. When Scrope\u2019s process is reconstructed, the evidence reveals him to be, at worst, passively antifeminist and, at best, an imprecise and uninformed translator. At its core, this analysis provides a methodology for examining manuscript traditions and reevaluating what previous scholars have meant when they term Scrope\u2019s Epistle a \u201cgood\u201d translation.</p><p>Bio: Misty Schieberle specializes in 14th- and 15th-century English literature, especially Chaucer, Gower, and Lydgate; gender and political literature; Christine de Pizan and medieval French literature in England; and manuscript studies. Her current research explores gender, fortune and fate, and manuscript studies in works by Chaucer, Gower, Lydgate, and Christine de Pizan that were popular in late medieval England. Her first monograph \u2013 <em>Feminized Counsel and the Literature of Advice in England, 1350-1500</em>\u00a0\u2013 explores Middle English political literature that represents women as wise, beneficial counselors to kings. She is currently working on a critical edition of medieval English translations of Christine de Pizan's <em>Epistre Othea</em>\u00a0for the Middle English Texts Series and related studies of the diverse manuscript history of the <em>Othea</em>\u00a0in French and English.</p>",

Assistant Professor Daniel Roberts leads a group of Ohio State Dancers to Salvador, Brazil to perform, study and engage in cultural exchange activities. They will perform in schools, childcare centers, a police station and two professional performing arts venues. Prior to their departure they will also perform for local schools here in Columbus.</p><p>The repertory of works curated by Daniel Roberts ranges from faculty to student work. These dances emphasize a shared history with Brazil: the diaspora of West African dance and music through the forced migration to the Americas through the slave trade. This history created different art forms in the two countries, derived from many of the same cultural roots. Thus the dance repertory includes jazz, hip-hop, the Charleston and tap, as well as contemporary dance performed to American jazz, bluegrass, rock and folk music.</p><p>\u00a0</p>",

At the core of this discourse lie questions<br>with a long history of artistic, philosophical, political and religious expression. The proper<br>management of space and resources, the negotiation of shifting boundaries between the<br>\u201chuman\u201d and \u201cnatural\u201d worlds (however one chooses to define these categories), as well as the<br>contemplation of humanity\u2019s place among the living and nonliving co-inhabitants of Earth are<br>all pursuits basic to human survival and livelihood. Moreover, the ways earlier generations<br>found to represent the natural world they experienced and their human community's place<br>within it have shaped the way we think and talk about such matters today.</p><p>This colloquium will bring together scholars from a range of humanities disciplines to share and<br>discuss theoretically-informed approaches to the study of human-environmental relationships<br>throughout history. We encourage contributions from graduate students in all fields of the<br>humanities, including anthropology, archaeology, art history, classics, English, geography,<br>history, landscape architecture, philosophy, theology and related fields.</p><p><strong>*A call for additonal (non-keynote) papers is currently open.\u00a0 Please see <a href=\"https://classics.osu.edu/sites/classics.osu.edu/files/Human_Nature_Call%20for%20Papers.pdf\">here</a> if interested.</strong></p>",

        "content": "<p>Lecture Title: \"Evil May Day, 1517: Riots Against Immigrants in Tudor London\"</p><p>Abstract: On the eve of May Day, 1517, rioting Londoners rose up in the night and attacked the homes and persons of strangers. From about nine o'clock the night of 30 April, the rioters ran through the streets of the City, targeting areas in which stranger artisans and merchants were known to live and work. By three in the morning, the riot had run its course and the City officials had re-established a precarious order. Although a later ballad portrayed Evil or Ill May Day, as the riot came to be known, as a \"bloody Slaughter\" of strangers, with the drainage channels in the streets running with blood, all the evidence suggests that no strangers lost their lives in the attacks, damage being limited to assaults and the sacking of houses and shops. A close examination of this episode in its own early sixteenth-century context offers us an entr\u00e9e into the complicated situation of the rioters' primary targets, the immigrant artisans, mostly Dutch, who lived in certain enclaves in the City, most numerously in the precinct of St. Martin le Grand. If the attacks they suffered on Evil May Day were hardly typical of their daily lives, the sparks for the riots and the responses from City and crown were part of the larger complex of their existence at the margins of London civic life.</p><p>Bio: Professor McSheffrey's research interests centre around law, mitigation,\u00a0gender roles,\u00a0civic culture, marriage, literacy, heresy, and popular religion in late medieval England.\u00a0 She has published a number of scholarly articles and four books, <i>Gender and Heresy: Women and Men in Lollard Communities, 1420-1530</i> (University of Pennsylvania Press, 1995); <i>Love and Marriage in Late Medieval London</i> (Medieval Institute Publications, 1995); <i>Lollards of Coventry 1486-1522</i> (co-authored with Norman Tanner), Camden Fifth Series, vol. 23 (Cambridge University Press, 2003);\u00a0<i>Marriage, Sex, and Civic Culture in Late Medieval London</i> (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2006). A fifth book, <i>Seeking Sanctuary: Law, Mitigation, and Politics in English Courts, 1400-1550</i>, is forthcoming from Oxford University Press in summer 2017.<i>\u00a0</i>She has won several awards for her research and teaching and was elected a fellow of the Royal Historical Society of the U.K. in 2002.</p>",

He has also published papers on John Stuart Mill, Kant and other figures in the history of philosophy. HIs 2012 book documented his developing interest in John Dewey and a pragmatic approach to philosophical issues.

        "content": "<p>Lecture Title: \"Christ Child Creator\"</p><p>Abstract: Most late medieval images of the child Jesus present him with clues that make explicit the unusual nature of his being and his sacrificial mission. The interpretive framework most often applied to such depictions is the so-called Proleptic Passion, that is, the anachronistic manifestation of Christ\u2019s death in scenes of his infancy \u2013 a conflation of the beginning and end of his human life. This paper examines several fifteenth-century prints of the Christ Child that include references to the Passion, ranging from subtle to overt: a seemingly innocent pose of sleep, the presence of the <em>Arma Christi</em> (usually the cross, the lance, or the crown of thorns), or even the wounds of the crucifixion. Especially fascinating is a little-known German woodcut of the Christ Child holding the <em>sudarium</em>, the cloth miraculously imprinted with the face of his adult self on the way to Calvary. Interpreted counter to the dominate model of the Proleptic Passion, this modest print proves to be a nuanced commentary on time and knowledge \u2013 both earthly and divine. Instead of simply collapsing time in a forward direction (present to future), the image also moves backward (present to past), as well as in both directions simultaneously. In the logic of the pictorial situation, the Christ Child unfurls his own image and thus reenacts the dynamics of the Incarnation, revealing his power (and identity) not only as Savior but also as Creator, as God the Father.</p><p>Bio: David S. Areford is Associate Professor of Art History at the University of Massachusetts, Boston. \u00a0He is the author of <em>The Art of Empathy: The Mother of Sorrows in Northern Renaissance Art and Devotion </em>(2013) and <em>The Viewer and the Printed Image in Late Medieval Europe </em>(2010).

The RNA group at OSU has a long history of interaction and active collaboration and is now recognized as an official university Center. Members of the Center for RNA Biology represent about a dozen departments throughout OSU. There are natural synergies between these two groups and this symposium is an opportunity not only to showcase the research of CMB Training Program and RNA Center members, but also to foster new interactions.</p>",

        "content": "We provide a perspective on the recent emergence of \u201ctopological spintronics,\u201d which relies on helical Dirac electrons on the surfaces of solids with strong spin-orbit coupling [1]..When timereversal symmetry is broken by ferromagnetic order, the helical Dirac states transition to chiral edge states [2]. This is a realization of Haldane\u2019s Chern insulator phase of matter, characterized by a precisely quantized Hall conductance and ballistic edge transport without a magnetic field, even in systems with significant electronic and magnetic disorder [3,4]. The interplay between these edge states, dissipative channels and magnetic order appears to yield a condensed matter realization of quantum tunneling out of a \u2018false vacuum\u2019 [4]. Interesting opportunities are also emerging for patterning and manipulating the edge states using optical techniques [5]. On a more pragmatic note, the helical spin texture of the surface states also leads to efficient spincharge conversion at room temperature [6,7], allowing one to envision novel devices for universal memory and spin-based logic.\u00a0[1] M.
